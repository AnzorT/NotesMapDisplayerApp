# NotesMapDisplayer

Welcome to NotesMapsDisplayer.

The task that was given to me consisted of working with Google maps as location API, Firebase database and authentication.
The purpose of the app is to create notes and save their date of creation, title and their content.
Before using the app, you must register with a valid email and password.
The user has two options to view the notes he created, he can view them in a list which is sorted according to date of creation or view them in a map using their location.



The program is written in android studio environment in java.
The services I used for presenting the map are Google maps and google location. The reason being it has very detailed API and instructions on how to use their services. 
For the database I am using Firebase since it is built for developing mobile and web apps, it displays the data in a user-friendly way, it has many useful features, the API is detailed and in my opinion it was a good choice to use it.  


For Map mode and List mode I have created them as fragments.
with activity, we can only have one individual activity on the screen whereas if we use fragments we can display multiple screen to the user and both of these modes are required to be presented on the same screen (Main screen).
